Lout to do:

- create basic document with title, author, arrangement and page numbers
- create a setup file for it
- install and use a downloaded font (maybe via Nix?) ~/.nix-profile/share/fonts/truetype/
- create six lines and put a bracket around the top 4
- create the strike/hand pairs like Don-R and Don-L
- write definitions to make the strike/hand pairs

Troubleshooting:
- if things are disappearing, check the logs, objects may be deleted if the paragraph doesn't fit
